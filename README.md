ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project! ðŸš€

I've been working on building a data warehouse using SQL Server in SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio). Here's a sneak peek of the entity-relationship diagram (ERD) I designed for the data warehouse:


Key Features:
Customer Data Integration:

Tables for both new and loyal customers.
Easy tracking of customer details, including age and address.
Product and Order Management:

Comprehensive schema for products and various order types.
Seamless linkages between products, orders, and company information.
Company and Transaction Tracking:

Centralized company table connected with orders and products.
Ability to monitor price details and order statuses.
Convenience Product Handling:

Dedicated table for managing convenience products and their quantities.
Why This Matters:
Efficiency: Streamlined data management for better performance.
Scalability: Designed to grow with the business needs.
Insights: Enhanced ability to generate actionable business insights.
I'm thrilled with the progress so far and can't wait to see how this data warehouse will empower data-driven decisions!
